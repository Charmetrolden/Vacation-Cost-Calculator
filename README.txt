**Vacation Cost Calculator**
The good part is that you found a program that roughly determines your vacation traveling costs based on destination and transportation method.

The program takes a few arguments, a method of transportation (string) and a distance (double).

The bad part is as more and more transportation methods, and features are supported, the program becomes harder to maintain.

**Example**
An example of a travel cost is the travel method Car, and the distance 15.0 should return 15.0.

**Solution**
Your task is to refactor the solution. Once you are done, it should be easy to add new transportation methods. You are free to refactor everything

The only thing youre not allowed to change is the programs input arguments.

**What you will be evaluated on**
You will be evaluated on your ability to refactor the given code.

- into easily maintainable code
- using the correct pattern(s)
- upholding best practices
